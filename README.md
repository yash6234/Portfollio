Portfolio (React + Vite)

How to run

- Install deps: `npm install`
- Start dev server: `npm run dev`
- Build: `npm run build` and `npm run preview`

Customization

- Replace the placeholder portrait by adding `public/profile.jpg` (Vite will serve it). The app currently uses `src/assets/profile.svg` as a default.
- Edit copy in components under `src/components/`.
- Colors and spacing live in `src/styles.css`.
